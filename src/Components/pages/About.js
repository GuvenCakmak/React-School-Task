              I am from Sweden, Stockholm. A place of nature and rich history.
              Since my childhood, i love playing computer games and design. I
              always had the thought when i was younger to design stuff with my
              unique point of view. I also love to create things that can be
              usefull to others.
              <br /> <br />
              I started coding since my friend recommended me to be a frontend
              developer where i could use my interest in design to code. Coding
              is also an art for me. I love it and now I have the opportunity to
              design along with the coding. I find it really interesting and I
              enjoy the process a lot.
              <br />
              <br />
              My vision is to make the world a better place. Now almost
              everything is becoming better than ever. It is time for us to
              create more good stuff that helps the world to become a better
              place.
